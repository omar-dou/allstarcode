# week3.day3.visData

## Instructions
1. Use command line to create a new project folder called “visData”
   - Create your typical website directory layout, including a “data.js” file
2. Go to https://randomuser.me/api
   - This website offers a simple service - it returns JSON data with random user information (the names, numbers, passwords, etc. are not real!)
   - Take a moment to see how the data is structured. 
   - You’ll be using data like this to make a website!
3. Look at [the documentation](https://randomuser.me/documentation) to see how you would request multiple users
   - The URL would look something like “https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5”
4. Make a request for anywhere between 10 and 30 users
5. Copy ALL of the JSON (`Ctrl + A` then `Ctrl + C`) and paste it into the “data.js” file storing it into a variable called `data`
   - In your “index.html” file, I would recommend referencing the “data.js” file and THEN a “main.js” file, which is where you’ll write your code. It’s a good idea to keep data and data manipulation separate!
6. Using everything you know about creating and designing websites, the DOM, event handlers, and objects, you will create a single web page that displays the JSON data in any way you see fit
7. Before you begin…
   - Wireframe your concept
     - Consider the following:
       - What information do you want to display? Some of it? All of it?
       - You can go to https://randomuser.me/ and see an example of visualizing one user
       - How would you visualize 10+ users?
       - The urls for the pictures work, so feel free to use them!
     - Once done, present your wireframe to your instructional team for approval.
       - If your wireframe is not approved, make any necessary revisions and try again.
   - Once approved, you may begin creating!
